# Why pointers are not allowed in Java?

- Security:
    - Pointer is a special type of variable which point to the memory location
    - Pointers allow user to access memory locations. So it is very risky. Hacker can easily modify our code and can get access to memory locations and can get all confidential files.
- Simplicity:
    - Pointers are complicated and this makes the code complicated. If not used correctly it can directly point to the memory location of OS which can cause system failure.
